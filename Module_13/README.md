# Laravel Installation and Folder Structure

Before you install Laravel, you need to make sure that you have PHP and Composer installed on your machine, as Laravel is a PHP framework and Composer is used for managing PHP dependencies.

#### Here are the steps you need to follow:

### 1. Install PHP
Any additional information goes here
Laravel requires PHP 7.3 or above. You can download it from the official PHP website. If you have PHP already installed, you can check your PHP version using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
  php -v
```

### 2. Install Composer
You can download Composer from its official website. To check if Composer is installed properly, type the following command:
```bash
  composer
```
This should display a list of Composer commands.

### 3. Install Laravel
Once you have PHP and Composer installed, you can install Laravel using Composer. Run the following command to install Laravel globally on your machine:
```bash
  composer global require laravel/installer
```
This command installs the Laravel installer, allowing you to create new Laravel projects.

### 4. Create a new Laravel project
To create a new Laravel project, navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run the following command:
Navigate into your project directory and start the Laravel development server:
```bash
  laravel new my-app
```

### 5. Start the Laravel development server
Navigate into your project directory and start the Laravel development server:
```bash
  cd my-app
  php artisan serve
```
This will start the server, and you can access your new Laravel application by opening http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
# Describe the purpose of the following Laravel folders

### app
This directory contains the core code of your application. All of the application logic is typically housed in this directory. It includes several subdirectories such as Http (which contains controllers, middleware, and requests), Providers (service providers), and others.

### bootstrap
This directory contains the scripts that Laravel uses to bootstrap, or start up, the framework itself. The app.php file is responsible for bootstrapping the application and the cache folder is used to contain performance-boosting files, like routes and config, for the application.

### config
This directory contains all of your application's configuration files. It's a great place to look to get a feel for the various options you can configure for your Laravel application.

### database
This directory contains your database migration and seeds. Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to modify and share the application's database schema easily. Seeds are used to populate your database with test data or default values.

### public
This directory contains the front-facing part of your website - namely, assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS files. The index.php in this directory serves as the front controller for all HTTP requests entering your application.

### resources
This directory contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, or JavaScript), and "localization" or language files.

### routes
This directory contains all of the route definitions for your application. By default, several route files are included with Laravel: web.php (routes that receive web, session state, CSRF protection, etc), api.php (stateless and are assigned the api middleware group), console.php (defines all of your closure based console commands), and channels.php (registers all of the event broadcasting channels that your application supports).

### storage
This directory contains compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework for caching purposes. This directory is segregated into app, framework, and logs directories. The app directory may be used to store any files generated by your application.

### tests
This directory contains your automated tests. An example PHPUnit test is provided out of the box. Each test class should be suffixed with the word Test.

### vendor
This directory contains your Composer dependencies. It's automatically populated by Composer, and you typically don't need to interact with it directly.
